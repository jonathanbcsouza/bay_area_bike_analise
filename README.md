## An√°lise de dados da Bay Area Bike Share

### Bay Area Bike Share is a company that offers bicycle rentals to customers in San Francisco, Redwood City, Palo Alto, Mountain View and San Jose. Users can unlock bicycles from various stations in each city and return them to any station within the same city. The service is paid by annual subscription or by purchasing three-day or 24-hour passes. Users can make an unlimited number of trips. Trips with less than thirty minutes of duration will have no additional cost; longer trips will incur overtime charges.

### This is the final project approved by Udacity in the course:
### [Nanodegree Data Foundations](https://br.udacity.com/course/fundamentos-data-science-i-python--nd110)

### I have incorporated some comments so that you can help current and future course students or data science in a didactic way.

### Description of requirements:

Bay Area Bike Share Data Analysis

In this project, you will put yourself in the position of an analyst to conduct an exploratory analysis of the data. You will review two of the key parts of the data analysis process: data cleansing and exploratory analysis. But before you start the analysis, think of some questions you might want to ask about the data. For example, if you were working for the Bay Area Bike Share: what kind of information would you like to have in order to make smarter business decisions? Or you can think of yourself as a user. What factors can influence the way you would like to use the service?
At the end of this project, you will be able to identify the key steps in the data analysis process. It is designed to help you make an informed decision about this type of work.

In addition to practicing the knowledge, you will also understand the process of submitting the project and the type of feedback you can expect from your reviewer.

Project Preparation
You should download the Jupyter Notebook file and run the program to start working on your data analysis. In this file, you will find all the step by step and the questions that must be answered.

The use of notebooks for analysis will be a common practice in your life as a data scientist. Get acquainted with creating a notebook for every review you make by sorting the designs by folders on your computer.
Case study
Initially, you will check an analysis done on this database. She was the winner of the contest promoted by Bay Area Bike Share. Notice how the author, Tyler Field, uses the graphs to draw conclusions about the data, and especially how he tells a story with the data.
Cleaning of data
The next step will be to clean the data. You will check for potential data problems and work to correct them, leaving the database ready for the next step.
Exploratory analysis
In this part, you will do a small analysis of the data using graphs. Because this is not a visualization course, you will make simple charts, but they will enable you to check the data and analyze the trends.
Your analysis and conclusion
To finish this project, you will do some analysis of your own and, through them, you will come to conclusions about the data.

With this, you will have done all the initial steps of a data science project. The next step would be to create predictive models that can explain the data and predict one or more characteristics of interest.
